<h2 align="center"><b>Overview</b></h2>

<br>

### Books
We will be using many recourses throughout this course, all open source and free. There will be a repo dedicated to keeping track of these items. The main text of the course can be found [https://mml-book.github.io/](https://mml-book.github.io/). The book is technically still being written, so best practice is to always goto the website to view the book. 

### Technology
We will be relying on technology during this course and you are encouraged to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new tools and new datasets. To boldly go where no Hamilton student has gone before! This being said, keep in mind this is a math class and you will expected to perform computations without the aid of technology. In particular, technology is not permitted on quizzes, midterm exams, or the final exam. Feel free to use computer software/web sites on the homework assignments, but keep in mind that you can't use them on exams or quizzes, so use them sparingly. 

<br>

<h2 align="center"><b>Types of Assignments & Grading Policies</b></h2>

<br>

### Homework
Homework will be assigned weekly via Blackboard. These assignemnts will be split into two parts, math/general questions and python questions. I understand that python is not a requirement for this course, familiarity with rudimentary computer programming was recommended. These assignments will be due on Thursdays and are to be submitted by pushing your work to your assigned repo. 

Once I am finished looking over your work, I will push your graded assignemnt back to the repo you submitted to. These repos are private and can only be seen by you and me. If you have any questions about the grading, please see me. 

I encourage you to work with your classmates on homework assignments! However, it is important to be an active collaborator rather than a passive one. On the majority of assignments, there will be a question asking who you collaborated with (includeing web pages). Using someone else code is fine in this class, but you must cite it. Falure to do so violates open source licences and is just lame. 

### Midterm and Final Exams
There will be three in-class exams, scheduled as follows. 
* Exam 1: 
* Exam 2: 
* Exam 3: 
The written final exam is scheduled by the registrar for Monday, December 16 7:00 - 10:00pm. 
I try my best to schedule exams so they do not conflict with religious observances; however, if an exam falls on a holiday you observe, please contact me as soon as possible to find an alternate time.\\

### Final Grade Composition
Your final grade will be computed as follows:

|Item | Percentage |
|---|---|
| Weekly Assignments | 40% |
| Projects | 20% |
| Exams | 40% |

The lower thresholds for final letter grades are as follows, though we reserve the right to curve:

| A+ | A | A- | B+ | B | B- | C+ | C | C- | D+ | D | D- |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 98 | 95 | 91 | 88 | 85 | 81 | 77 | 74 | 70 | 66 | 63 | 60 |

We generally do not round final grades (e.g., 90.7 is a B+).

<h2 align="center"><b>Help, Accessibility, Attendance, & Honor</b></h2>

<br>

### Help
For any coursework-related questions you have, please come to office hours. Collaboration on the homework is permitted (and \textbf{strongly encouraged!}) as long as you are collaborating with your peers currently enrolled in a section of Math 116. However, write up your final drafts individually to ensure that you have each fully understood the answer(s).\endnote{Honor Code issues aside, you're doing your education a disservice if you turn in work you have not personally thought through carefully.}  Please check before using resources other than the professors teaching this class, your classmates in any of the sections, or campus tutors.  That is, check before asking other professors, students not currently enrolled in the class, the internet, etc.  Mathematical plagiarism is a subtle business, and it's easy to accidentally plagiarize by copying a solution you've read somewhere else.\endnote{Seriously, though: you can't ``unsee'' someone else's solution.  There are deep and interesting ethical conundra lurking here; Googling unwisely (or at all) may lead you down a path you didn't intend to follow.}\\

### Accessibility
Any student needing academic adjustments or accommodations should speak with one of us during the first two weeks of class as well as Allen Harrison, Assistant Dean of Students for International Students and Accessibility (\href{mailton:aharriso@hamilton.edu}{aharriso@hamilton.edu}; Elihu Root House; x4021).  And, as with all things related to your academic pursuits on the Hill, you are welcome to talk to us if you need some help figuring out how to access the resources available to you.
\\

### Attendance and Honor
It's up to you when to miss class; you may choose not to come because of illness, an athletic event, or a religious observance.  By enrolling in this class, however, you are agreeing to be an engaged student, to have a learner's attitude when you come to class, and to encourage your fellow students to do the same.\endnote{If you wantonly skip classes, aside from missing out on the learning community within the walls of our classroom, you'll penalize yourself by getting lower grades than you otherwise would.  And anyway, although we don't take formal attendance, we \textbf{do} notice if you're not in class.} You are part of a community that believes in the power of the Honor Code to make Hamilton College a great place to be a student and a teacher.  We are \textit{all} bound by the responsibility to actively create and maintain a culture of learning, academic integrity, and personal honor.  We do not take our responsibility lightly; nor should you.

## Materials

* __Website.__ 
The website for the course is the GitHub organization [https://github.com/csc-171](https://github.com/csc-171).  The labs and homework assignments will be posted on GitHub as well as other resources and materials. 


* __Text.__ Objects First with Java, A Practical Introduction Using BlueJ, David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling, Sixth Edition. Link to book: [https://www.vitalsource.com/referral?term=9780134478449](https://www.vitalsource.com/referral?term=9780134478449)


## Assessment 


* __Labs.__ Labs are intended to be self contained and help to enhance understanding of the lectures. 

* __Weekly Assignments.__ Exercises to help identify mistakes in code. 

* __Projects.__ There will be 3-4 projects throughout the semester. These projects are intended to help you master various aspects of the Java programing language. 

* __Exams.__ There will be a total of two exams in the course. The exam dates and times can be found on the course calendar and are subject to change due to the nature of the course.



## Grading Rational

The final grade will be determined by your performance on homework, quizzes, exams, and the final examination. The final grade is weighted as follows:

|Item | Percentage |
|---|---|
| Labs | 10% |
| Weekly Assignments | 10% |
| Projects | 40% |
| Exams | 40% |


## Attendance Policy

There is no component in the grading scheme of this course for attendance. However, you will need to come to class on time in order to get the best possible grade in this class. If you miss a class for a medical reason or other valid excuse, you will be given an opportunity to make up any missing material. But if you cut class without a valid reason, your grade will suffer.

Only students who are registered for courses, and whose name appears on the Official Class Roster may attend courses at the University. Adelphi students make a commitment to be active participants in their educational program; class attendance is an integral part of this commitment. Students are expected to be present promptly at the beginning of each class period, unless prevented by illness or by other compelling cause. In the event of such absence, students may request that faculty members be notified by the Office of Academic Services and Retention. Students are responsible for completing course work missed through absences. Students should wait a reasonable length of time for an instructor in the event that the instructor is delayed.

## Students With Disabilities

If you have a disability that may significantly impact your ability to carry out assigned coursework, please contact the Student Access Office (SAO) at 516-877-3145 or send an email to [sao@adelphi.edu](mailto:sao@adelphi.edu).  The staff will review your concerns and determine, with you, appropriate and necessary accommodations.  Please allow for a reasonable time frame for requesting ASL Interpreters or Transcription Services.


## Course Learning Goals 

These are my goals for you over the course of the semester. I would also be interested to hear any other goals you have for yourself.
* Students will successfully communicate mathematics through reading, writing and speaking.
* Students will value peer collaboration and group learning while continuing to maintain a sense of self-motivation and personal understanding.
* Students will work to solve difficult problems. Value the process of figuring them out yourself, rather
than just searching for "the answer."
* Students will be prepared to continue in the major and use the tools of this course as they apply
to other disciplines.
* We will all have FUN learning together!



## Honor Code Statement

Students enrolled in this course are expected to abide by the Adelphi University Honor Code. The purpose of the Honor Code is to protect the academic integrity of the University by encouraging consistent ethical behavior in assigned coursework by students. Following is excerpted from the Student Honor Code:

> __The Code of Academic Honesty__
> The code of academic honesty prohibits behavior, which can broadly be described as lying, cheating, or stealing. Violations of the code of academic honesty will include, but are not limited to, the following:
> 1. Fabricating data or citations
> 2. Collaborating in areas prohibited by the professor
> 3. Unauthorized multiple submission of work
> 4. Sabotage of othersâ work, including library vandalism or manipulation
> 5. Plagiarism: presenting any work as oneâs own that is not oneâs own
> 6. The creation of unfair advantage
> 7. The facilitation of dishonesty
> 8. Tampering with or falsifying records
> 9. Cheating on examinations through the use of written materials or giving or receiving help in any form during the exam, including talking, signals, electronic devices, etc.


## Student Course Evaluations

During the last two weeks of the class, you will receive notification, via email and
eCampus, that the course evaluation is available for your input electronically.
Availability will end at the start of the final examination period. Your feedback is valuable and I encourage you to respond. Please be assured that your responses are anonymous and the results will not be available to the instructor until after the end of the semester and therefore after course grades have been submitted.



## General Education Learning Goals & Distribution Requirements

This course fulfills the Quantitative Learning Goal for General Education at Adelphi University. It also fulfills the Formal Science Distribution requirement.



## Classroom Conduct

Conduct is important in the classroom as it is in the workplace.  In Adelphi classes, people are expected to treat others with respect and dignity at all times.  Any behavior, which is disruptive to the learning environment, is strictly prohibited.  Disruptive behavior may result in action including reduction in the final grade and/or withdrawal from class.



## Religious Holidays

Any student in this course who plans to observe a religious holiday which conflicts in any way with the course schedule or requirements should contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternative accommodations.
