<h2 align="center"><b>Overview</b></h2>

<br>

### Introduction
Machine learning is a very broad subject and needless to say we will not be covering all of it. In this course we will focus on the three main algorithms, Support Vector Modules (SVM), Principle Component Analysis (PCA), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). As this is a math course, we will focus on the how these algorithms work, giving proofs along the way. The math we will learn can be thought of as an extension of both linear algebra and multivariable calculus. We will use some probablility and statistics along the way, but will try to keep it at the level learnen in High School. 

As the application of the mathematics is also important, the homework and projects will give you a place to actually write code implemeting the mathimatical ideas of the course. We will be using real datasets to get our feet wet in the machine learing world. 

### Books
We will be using many recourses throughout this course, all open source and free. There will be a repo dedicated to keeping track of these items. The main text of the course can be found [https://mml-book.github.io/](https://mml-book.github.io/). The book is technically still being written, so best practice is to always goto the website to view the book. 

### Technology
We will be relying on technology during this course and you are encouraged to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new tools and new datasets. To boldly go where no Hamilton student has gone before! This being said, keep in mind this is a math class and you will expected to perform computations without the aid of technology. In particular, technology is not permitted on quizzes, midterm exams, or the final exam. Feel free to use computer software/web sites on the homework assignments, but keep in mind that you can't use them on exams or quizzes, so use them sparingly.

<h2 align="center"><b>Types of Assignments & Grading Policies</b></h2>

<br>

### Homework
Homework will be assigned weekly via Blackboard. These assignemnts will be split into two parts, math/general questions and python questions. I understand that python is not a requirement for this course, familiarity with rudimentary computer programming was recommended. These assignments will be due on Thursdays and are to be submitted by pushing your work to your assigned repo. 

Once I am finished looking over your work, I will push your graded assignemnt back to the repo you submitted to. These repos are private and can only be seen by you and me. If you have any questions about the grading, please see me. 

I encourage you to work with your classmates on homework assignments! However, it is important to be an active collaborator rather than a passive one. On the majority of assignments, there will be a question asking who you collaborated with (includeing web pages). Using someone else code is fine in this class, but you must cite it. Falure to do so violates open source licences and is just lame. 

### Projects
There will be three projects through the course. These will be team projects and the goal is to use python to implement the various machine learning algorithms we will be talking about. Each project will be host on [https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com). The goal fo these projects is to get you familiar with the packages and tools of the trade. It is completely fine to use code you find online as long as you cite it. While using someone elses code is approvewd, you must be able to explain how it works. You will be graded on the accuracy of your results, as well as on the quality of documentation of your code.

### Midterm and Final Exams
There will be two in-class exams, scheduled as follows. 
* Exam 1: Wednesday, October 16 (before Fall Break)
* Exam 2: Wednesday, Noveber 20 (before Thanksgiving Break)

The final exam is scheduled by the registrar for Monday, December 16 7:00 - 10:00pm. 
I try my best to schedule exams so they do not conflict with religious observances; however, if an exam falls on a holiday you observe, please contact me as soon as possible to find an alternate time.


### Final Grade Composition
Your final grade will be computed as follows:

|Item | Percentage |
|---|---|
| Weekly Assignments | 40% |
| Projects | 20% |
| Exams | 40% |

<br>

### Help
For any coursework-related questions you have, please come to office hours. Collaboration on the homework is permitted (and **strongly encouraged!**. However, write up your final drafts individually to ensure that you have each fully understood the answer(s). Honor Code issues aside, you're doing your education a disservice if you turn in work you have not personally thought through carefully.  If you use someone elses code, or found a solution online, make sure and cite your source. 

### Accessibility
Any student needing academic adjustments or accommodations should speak with one of us during the first two weeks of class as well as Allen Harrison, Assistant Dean of Students for International Students and Accessibility ([aharriso@hamilton.edu}](mailton:aharriso@hamilton.edu); Elihu Root House; x4021).  And, as with all things related to your academic pursuits on the Hill, you are welcome to talk to us if you need some help figuring out how to access the resources available to you.

### Attendance and Honor
It's up to you when to miss class; you may choose not to come because of illness, an athletic event, or a religious observance.  By enrolling in this class, however, you are agreeing to be an engaged student, to have a learner's attitude when you come to class, and to encourage your fellow students to do the same. If you wantonly skip classes, aside from missing out on the learning community within the walls of our classroom, you'll penalize yourself by getting lower grades than you otherwise would.  And anyway, although I don't take formal attendance, I do notice if you're not in class. You are part of a community that believes in the power of the Honor Code to make Hamilton College a great place to be a student and a teacher.  We are _all_ bound by the responsibility to actively create and maintain a culture of learning, academic integrity, and personal honor.
